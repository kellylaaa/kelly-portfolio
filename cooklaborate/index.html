                            <p>People often don't have time to cook for themselves every day or struggle with finding new and easy recipes to make. As a result, they either resort to ordering takeout, meal prepping in bulk, or cooking the same meals everyday. The first option is costly and also tends to be unhealthy. The second and last option, while it is cheaper and more nutritious, eating the same few meals for several days at a time easily can get repetitive and boring.</p>
